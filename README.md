# BSD 3204 Machine Learning Cat 2 Assignment

This repository contains the code and documentation for the BSD 3204 Machine Learning CAT 2. This assignment focuses on building and evaluating a Generalized Random Forest (GRF) model using spatial data.

## Overview

The project aims to:
- Load and preprocess spatial data using the `sf` package in R.
- Select relevant variables of interest for the analysis.
- Mutate and preprocess variables to prepare them for modeling.
- Divide the data into training and test sets.
- Build a Generalized Random Forest (GRF) model using the `grf` package.
- Evaluate the model's performance and interpret the results.

## Project Structure

The main components of this project are:
- **Code:** Contains the R script (`gwrf 9.R`) used to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Data:** Includes the shapefile (`fpc9.shp`) and any other necessary data files used in the analysis.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
- **Documentation:** Additional documentation or reports related to the assignment (if any).

## Instructions

To run the code and reproduce the analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R script `gwrf 9.R` in your R environment (e.g., RStudio).
3. Ensure that all required packages mentioned in the script are installed (`sf`, `grf`, etc.).
4. Execute the script step by step or all at once to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
5. Review the results and interpretations provided in the script and any additional documentation.
